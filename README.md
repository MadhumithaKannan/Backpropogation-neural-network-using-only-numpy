# Backpropogation-neural-network-using-only-numpy

I have implemented a simple backpropogation neural network from scratch using only numpy. 

## Introduction
This is a neural network with two inputs, two hidden neurons, two output neurons. the hidden and output neurons contain bias.
This neural network can be extended by adding more inputs by using the weight_init() function and initializing the input array with new inputs.

## Visualizations:
From the 3 plots we can observe how the error diminishes upon 10,100 and 1000 iterations. 
The error during the initial 10 iterations is approximately 0.22 and it reduces to 0.000992 in the 1000th iteration.
